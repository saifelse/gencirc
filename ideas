Connecting components
---------------------

If we try to draw a line between C_1 and C_2,

The vertical depth of the line is dependent on the horizontal distance between the C_1 and C_2.
The closer together they are, the less deep it needs to be. 

Where a line connects to a component depends on which the signed distance between C_1 and C_2.
The more negative, more to the right towards center.
The more positive, more to the left towards center.
